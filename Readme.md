# AI-Powered Excel Mock Interviewer

**Deployed Application:** [https://ai-engineer-assignment.vercel.app](https://ai-engineer-assignment.vercel.app)

## 1. Business Context & Problem Statement

Our company is rapidly expanding its Finance, Operations, and Data Analytics divisions. A key skill for all new hires is advanced proficiency in Microsoft Excel. However, our current screening process is a major bottleneck:

- **Time-consuming manual interviews** for senior analysts
- **Inconsistent evaluations** across different interviewers
- **Slowed hiring pipeline** impacting growth targets
- **Resource-intensive process** that doesn't scale

We believe an AI-driven solution can solve this problem by providing automated, consistent, and scalable Excel skill assessment.

## 2. Solution Strategy & Approach

### Design Philosophy
As the founding AI Product Engineer, I designed a **conversational AI interviewer** that simulates real human interview dynamics while maintaining consistency and scalability. The solution focuses on:

- **Natural conversation flow** that puts candidates at ease
- **Intelligent answer evaluation** using advanced LLM capabilities
- **Comprehensive feedback generation** for hiring decisions
- **Professional transcript generation** for record-keeping

### Technical Approach
The system uses a **hybrid architecture** combining:
- **FastAPI backend** for robust interview logic and session management
- **React frontend** for professional user experience
- **Groq API (Llama-3)** for intelligent answer evaluation and feedback
- **PDF generation** for comprehensive interview transcripts

## 3. Core Requirements Implementation

### ✅ 1. Structured Interview Flow
The agent manages a coherent, multi-turn conversation that simulates a real interview:

```python
# Interview stages in interview_engine.py
stages = ["intro", "warmup", "interview", "summary"]
```

- **Introduction**: Professional greeting and process explanation
- **Warm-up Questions**: 3 general questions to establish rapport
- **Technical Questions**: 12 Excel-specific questions covering key skills
- **Conclusion**: Comprehensive performance summary

### ✅ 2. Intelligent Answer Evaluation
The core challenge is solved through LLM-powered evaluation:

```python
# From llm_service.py
async def evaluate_answer(question, answer):
    prompt = f"""
    You are an expert Excel interviewer. Evaluate the following candidate answer.
    Question: "{question}"
    Answer: "{answer}"
    Give a score out of 10, and briefly explain the rating.
    """
    return await ask_llm(prompt)
```

- **Context-aware scoring**: Each answer evaluated against specific Excel concepts
- **Detailed feedback**: Scores with explanations for hiring decisions
- **Consistent evaluation**: Standardized criteria across all candidates

### ✅ 3. Agentic Behavior and State Management
The agent thinks and acts like a real interviewer:

- **Session persistence**: Unique session IDs with complete state tracking
- **Dynamic responses**: Detects confusion and provides helpful clarifications
- **Interviewer persona**: Maintains professional tone throughout
- **Adaptive flow**: Handles edge cases and user interactions naturally

### ✅ 4. Constructive Feedback Report
Comprehensive performance summary generated at interview conclusion:

- **Strengths identification**: Highlights candidate's Excel competencies
- **Weakness analysis**: Identifies areas for improvement
- **Overall impression**: Holistic assessment for hiring decisions
- **Professional formatting**: Clean, actionable feedback
